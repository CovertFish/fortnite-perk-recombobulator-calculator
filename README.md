recombobulator perk calculator

Made this because i didn't find one,
its made with my limited knowegde of java coding.

It works by taking in the level and perks active and revering the active perks but leaving them on the weapon, so when the percent value is changed its reflected to be within 1 of the correct values do to me learning BigDecimal as i coded its(Zero is base value).

Also do to limited abilities of mine all perks affecting one value must be stacked upon its ie "Damage", "Damage +15%" and "Damage +10%" must be entered as "Damage +25%" in one perk area("Damage to" doesn't affect the "Damage" perk, leave it out).

QUIT BUTTON MUST BE USED OR IT WILL NEVER STOP RUNNING IN BACKGROUND!
